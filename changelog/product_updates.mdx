## Flip Camera Function

Our ID Verification Widget now has a camera flip feature. This allows your users to switch between the front and back cameras on their mobile or tablet devices. They can use the front camera to take a selfie or the back camera to capture an ID photo.

### How to Enable It

You can enable this camera flip functionality on your Dojah-powered KYC widget with a simple toggle on your dashboard. Once a user clicks the camera flip button, the system will remember their preference for future sessions.

## More African Countries in Our Database

We've added more African countries to our database for the EasyOnboard and KYC-KYB Widgets. Now you can look up and verify users with different types of IDs in these countries:

### Ghana 🇬🇭

We expanded our Ghana API to include digital addresses. Your users can input their digital address number, and you can instantly validate their exact location, including the postcode, community, district, and region. This is useful for logistics, e-commerce, banking, and lending businesses.

### Zimbabwe 🇿🇼

You can now verify users from Zimbabwe using their National ID. We can also run a credit check on them. You can look up and verify their first name, last name, date of birth, sex, and place of birth.

### South Africa 🇿🇦

You can look up and verify users' National IDs and phone numbers from South Africa. Users can input their national ID, and it can be verified against their liveness image on the KYC widget. You can set this up using our no-code verification tool, EasyOnboard.

### Angola 🇦🇴

You can look up and verify users' National IDs and phone numbers from Angola. Users can input their national ID, and it can be verified against their liveness image on the KYC widget. You can set this up using our no-code verification tool, EasyOnboard.
