title: "Webhooks"
description: "Webhooks allow ProfiledRisk to send real-time decisions, score outcomes, and behavioral insights back to your system immediately after an event is evaluated. This enables automated enforcement in your own transaction, onboarding, or lending workflows."
---



When your Flow triggers a decision, ProfiledRisk sends a signed webhook request to the endpoint you configure on the Dashboard.

  

## **Configuring Webhooks**

You can subscribe to webhook notifications directly from each Flow in the Dashboard.

> Manage flows → View flow → Settings → Webhook Info

Each Flow can have **its own unique webhook URL**. This allows different event types to notify different internal services if required.

After adding a webhook URL, select **Save changes** to activate delivery.
