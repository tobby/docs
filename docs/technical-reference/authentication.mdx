description: "Learn how to authenticate requests to Dojah APIs."

---

Securely authenticate all Dojah API calls by following this simple lifecycle: 
create your app, generate API keys, select environments, and sign each request with your credentials.

***

#### Create an App

- Log in to the Dojah Dashboard and go to **Developers → Configuration → My Apps**.
- Create a new app or edit the default one. 
        - Enter an App Name; 
        - Optionally add a logo and primary color if you'll use widgets like EasyOnboard.
- Each App has a unique **App ID**, this is required for all API calls.

***


#### API Keys

- Once your app is created, you can generate **public** and **private** API keys.
- **Public Key**: Meant for front-end usage (e.g. SDKs or widgets).
- **Private Key**: Must remain confidential; used for authenticating server-side API calls.
- Keys can be regenerated anytime from the dashboard.

Each app comes with two keys:
- **App ID**: Public identifier used in API calls.
- **Secret Key**: Private key for signing and securing requests.

<Note> Do not expose your Secret Key on the frontend or in public repositories. It should only be used server-side. </Note>

#### Environments

Dojah supports both sandbox and production environments:

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Sandbox     | `https://sandbox.dojah.io` |
| Production  | `https://api.dojah.io`     |

> 📘 **Note**  
> - Always use HTTPS for all API requests.  
> - Make sure you have created an app before sending any request.  
> - Keep your Secret Key secure—never share it or expose it publicly.

***

#### Authorization

For every API request, include your App ID and Secret Key in the request headers:

```http
AppId: YOUR_APP_ID
Authorization: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
