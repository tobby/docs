description: "All ProfiledRisk API requests must be authenticated using your private API Secret Key. Requests without valid authentication will be rejected."

Authentication applies to every endpoint in the ProfiledRisk API.

## **Base URL**

    
    
All API requests made **must** include a base URL. Below are the base URLs for each environment.

SANDBOX ==> [https://sandbox.profiledrisk.com/api](https://sandbox.profiledrisk.com/api)

PRODUCTION ==> [https://api.profiledrisk.com/api](https://api.profiledrisk.com/api)


This is the base domain used for all API interactions.

You must append the correct endpoint path for each API call.  
Specific endpoints will be referenced in subsequent sections of this documentation.



## **Header Authentication**

Every API request must include your Secret Key in the `Authorization` header.

  

## **API Keys**

ProfiledRisk uses **a single Secret Key** for live transactions

> **Developers → API Keys**

Treat your Secret Key like a password.  
Do not expose it in client-side, browser, or mobile applications.







Example:

### Request

```http [POST]
{{baseURL}}/api/events
```


```json Body
    {
      "type": "payments",
      "event": { ... }
    }
```




## **Security Best Practices**

To maintain compliance and protect your risk infrastructure:

-   **Never** store credentials directly in code repositories
    
-   Use a secure secrets manager for environment variables
    
-   Restrict access to keys based on least privilege
    
-   Rotate credentials if leakage is suspected
    
-   Disable and regenerate unused keys regularly
    

ProfiledRisk logs all API usage against your keys for audit purposes.
