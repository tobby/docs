This section defines the core terms used across the ProfiledRisk APIs, dashboard, webhooks, and reports. These definitions are consistent across all use cases (Onboarding, Banking, Payments, Lending, and Reporting).

### Core Entities

**Profile**  
A unique entity being monitored by ProfiledRisk. This can represent a user, customer, merchant, device, agent, wallet, or any identifier you choose. All related events, scores, and cases are linked to a Profile.

**Profile ID**  
A unique identifier assigned by ProfiledRisk to a profile. It appears in API responses, dashboard views, and reports. It is different from your internal `user_id` or account identifier, but they are linked.

**Event**  
A single occurrence sent from your system to ProfiledRisk, such as a login, payment attempt, onboarding action, transfer, or loan request. Events are evaluated against rules and intelligence to produce a decision.

**Event ID**  
A unique identifier assigned by ProfiledRisk to each event. Used for traceability across API logs, cases, and reports.

**Case**  
An investigation object created when an event or profile requires manual review. Cases group related context (events, risk factors, device history) and record analyst decisions.

**Case ID**  
Unique identifier for a Case in ProfiledRisk. Used in dashboard, audit logs, and reports.

  

### Rules, Flows, and Logic

**Flow**  
A configuration of rules and checks that define how a specific event type is evaluated. Flows are managed in the dashboard and determine which conditions must be met for a status to be returned.

**Rule**  
A single conditional statement used within a Flow. For example:  
“If `amount` > 100000 AND `device` is new THEN set status to `pending`.”

**Risk Logic**  
The combined evaluation of flows, rules, and intelligence signals applied to each event. This logic produces the final `status`, `risk_score`, and `risk_level`.

  

### Event Classification Fields

**type**  
Top-level category for an event. Examples include:

-   `onboarding`
    
-   `banking`
    
-   `payments`
    
-   `lending`
    

The `type` value determines which flow(s) and rule sets will evaluate the event.

**channel**  
How the event was initiated in your system. Common examples:

-   `mobile`
    
-   `online`
    
-   `pos`
    
-   `atm`
    
-   `branch`
    

Used for behavioral analysis and channel-specific rules.

**purpose**  
Business intent of the event or transaction (for example `salary payment`, `bill payment`, `airtime`, `transfer`). Used primarily for rule conditions and analytics.

**direction** (where applicable)  
Describes the movement of funds for a transaction. Common values:

-   `inbound`
    
-   `outbound`
    

Used in Banking/Payments contexts for exposure and laundering checks.

  

### Risk and Decision Fields

**status**  
The primary decision output returned by ProfiledRisk for an evaluated event. Possible values:

-   `allowed` – event is considered safe to proceed
    
-   `blocked` – event should not proceed
    
-   `pending` – event requires manual review before proceeding
    

Your system is expected to enforce this status in your own workflow.

**risk\_score**  
A numeric value representing the assessed risk of the event or profile. Typically a range from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate higher risk.

**risk\_level**  
A categorical classification derived from the `risk_score`, such as:

-   `low`
    
-   `medium`
    
-   `high`
    
-   `very high`
    

Levels can be mapped to your internal policies for routing or escalation.

  

### User and Context Fields

These fields are not enforced globally but appear frequently across event payloads:

**user\_id**  
Your internal identifier for the user or account. Used to link your system to a Profile in ProfiledRisk.

**user\_type**  
Describes the category of the profile

**account\_type**  
Type of account serviced by your system.

**tier**  
Internal classification of the user or account, often linked to KYC or product access

**kyc\_information**  
Structured identity data (for example `id_number`, `id_type`, `country`) sent during onboarding or updates. Used for risk and compliance checks.

**device**  
Object describing device attributes such as `device_id`, `os`, `model`, `language`, `ip_address`. Used to detect account takeover, device sharing, and network anomalies.

**address**  
Structured postal or location information associated with the user or transaction. Often used for geolocation risk, jurisdiction checks, and AVS-related logic.

**meta**  
Flexible key-value structure for custom attributes that are specific to your product or risk model. Meta fields are not predefined by ProfiledRisk but can be used inside your rules.

  

### Reporting and Compliance

**STR (Suspicious Transaction Report)**  
Report generated when activity is confirmed as suspicious. Prepared by ProfiledRisk and downloaded by your compliance team for filing.

**CTR (Currency Transaction Report)**  
Report generated for cash or cash-equivalent transactions that meet defined threshold rules.

**FTR (Fraud Transaction Report)**  
Report generated when transactions are confirmed as fraud after investigation.

**Reporting Entity**  
The regulated institution or organization responsible for filing STR/CTR/FTR documents. Entity details are configured once in the dashboard and reused across all reports.

  

### Webhook and Integration Terms (High Level)

**Webhook**  
An HTTP callback configured by you to receive decisions and case-related notifications from ProfiledRisk in real time.

**Webhook endpoint**  
The URL in your system that ProfiledRisk sends event decisions and updates to.

  

### How to Use This Glossary

-   Use these definitions as the baseline when reading API responses, event schemas, and dashboard labels.
    
-   Any field that appears in multiple endpoints will use the meaning defined here.
    
-   Schema-specific documentation will only detail field format and constraints, not re-define the concept.
