Event Ingestion is how you send activity data to ProfiledRisk for evaluation. Each event is processed by a Flow, evaluated against your rules and ProfiledRisk intelligence, and returns a decision that you can enforce in your system.

ProfiledRisk supports two ingestion modes per Flow:

-   **Realtime URL** – for live decisioning on production traffic
    
-   **Backfill URL** – for historical or batch events
    

The keys for each url can be gotten from the dashboard, and you can view the schema for each user type under the payload schemas
