**How to Generate Widget**

Using the Dojah CDN-hosted Javascript client library, you can install the Dojah widget into your application by simply adding a script tag to your HTML document and insert basic configuration parameters.

**Step 1: Add the Client Javascript Library**

Add the script tag before the end of the closing body tag of your desired HTML page where you desire to give users the ability to authorize access to a financial institution.

```javascript javascript
<script src="https://widget.dojah.io/widget.js"></script>
```

> #### ❗️Adding the async attribute can cause the inline code to return undefined because the library may not be available at that moment. So avoid the use of async and defer for now.

**Step 2: Configure the Javascript Client Library**

At this stage, you can now create a Dojah widget object by passing in your public key in javascript object representing your preferred configuration options.

```javascript javascript
const options = {
  app_id: app_id, //your app_id here
  p_key: p_key, //your production public key here
  type: 'custom',
  user_data: {
    first_name: {$first_name}, //optional
    last_name: {$last_name}, //optional
    dob: {$dob}, //YYYY-MM-DD Optional
    residence_country: 'NG', //optional
    email: {$email}//optional
  },
  gov_data : {
    "bvn": "123456789", //
    "nin": "123456789", //
  },
  metadata: {
    user_id: '12xxxxsxsxsxssx1',
  },
  
  config: {
    widget_id: ""  //this is generated from easyonboard here https://app.dojah.io/easy-onboard

  },
  onSuccess: function (response) {
    console.log('Success', response);
  },
  onError: function (err) {
    console.log('Error', err);
  },
  onClose: function () {
    console.log('Widget closed');
  }
};

const connect = new Connect(options);
const button = document.querySelector('#button-connect');
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  connect.setup();
  connect.open();
});
```

## Typescript implementation

If you want to use typescript on some classes that are not available now or in the future, you could look at extending the global 'window' interface. You can follow below steps to guide you:
With typescript, you need to extend the global Window interface with additional properties.
Create a new folder "types"
Add a file "index.d.ts"
Put below code inside your "index.d.ts" file

```typescript typescript
export { };
declare global {
    interface Window {
        Connect: any;
	//add more properties you would like to extend
    }
}
```


set your compilerOptions "typeRoots" property to path of your type folder
E.g ["./src/types"]
Use the extended window property anywhere like this:

```typescript typescript
const connect = new window.Connect(options);

```

**Step 3: Handle a Successful Verification**

On successful enrollment, the onSuccess callback function that you supplied is called by the client library. We then return the connected account code to your server.

Kindly use the overall status (**response.status** (Boolean, i.e true or false)) to ascertain if the request failed or succeeded.

> #### 📘 Webhook Notifications
> 
> 
> You can receive the same data below (also passed to onSuccess and onError) via a webhook call.
> 
> Register your url for webhook calls [here](https://docs.dojah.io/docs/subscribe-to-services) and ensure `kyc.widget` is the `service` you are subscribed to.
> 
> In Config object Kindly set **webhook** object value to true (Boolean)
> 
> Example : **webhook : true**

**The Sample response data after successful verification**
