-   Detection of **multi-accounting** and **synthetic identities**
    
-   Early identification of **account takeover risks**
    
-   Identification of **fraud clusters** tied to specific devices
    
-   **Behavioural profiling** of legitimate users over time
    
-   Stronger signals in **web and mobile** channels where IPs fluctuate
    

> A strong device identifier dramatically increases ProfiledRisk’s precision when linking events to a profile.

  

## Web Implementation — DeviceGuard SDK

You can collect a browser fingerprint and pass a consistent `device_id` into all event ingestion requests.

### Integration Example

```javascript DeviceGuard

    <!-- Step 1: Include DeviceGuard SDK from CDN -->
    <script src="https://your-domain.com/sdk/deviceguard.min.js"></script>
    
    <script>
      // Step 2: Create an instance with your SDK configuration
      const deviceGuard = new DeviceGuard({
        apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
        endpoint: 'https://your-domain.com',
        debug: true
      });
    
      // Step 3: Initialize SDK
      deviceGuard.init()
        .then(result => {
          console.log('Device ID:', result.deviceId);
    
          // Include this ID in your ingestion payload:
          // device.device_id = result.deviceId
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error('DeviceGuard initialization failed:', error);
        });
    </script>
    
    ```

This identifier should be included in the `device.device_id` field for:

-   Onboarding events
    
-   Login events
    
-   Payment / Banking / Lending events
    
-   Any future behavioural event you define
    

This ensures event-to-profile linking remains consistent across the user lifecycle.

## Mobile SDK Guidance

Mobile applications inherently provide more stable identifiers than the browser. For both iOS and Android:

> We strongly advise using the **Advertising ID** as the `device_id`.

Benefits:

-   Globally unique per device
    
-   Resettable by the user → compliant with privacy expectations
    
-   Available before authentication to detect risk during onboarding
    
-   Ties user behaviour across apps on the same device (optional advantage)
    
-     
    

Ensure the value is passed as:

    "device": {
      "device_id": "<advertising-id>",
      "type": "mobile",
      "os": "iOS" or "Android"
    }
    

  

## Best Practices

Best Practice

Why It Matters

Capture device\_id **before** signup/login

Detect returning fraudsters who use new accounts

Use **same fingerprint logic** across channels

Prevent siloed identity profiles

Store device\_id locally & reuse

Avoid fragmentation of the user’s risk profile

Pair with IP + geolocation + device metadata

Improves anomaly and behaviour-based detection

  

## Summary

A Profile is only as strong as the signals tied to it. Device fingerprinting ensures ProfiledRisk can:

-   Track behavioural risk evolution
    
-   Catch repeated fraud behaviours hidden across new accounts
    
-   Support higher-confidence automated decisions
    

This significantly reduces **false negatives** in fraud detection and **false positives** against good customers.
