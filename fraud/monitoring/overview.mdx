EasyDetect is our Fraud Monitoring solution that allow businesses fight fraud by setting rules and conditions that would serve as blockers. 

This solution can be used with the following industries and more:

1.  E-commerce : identify fraudulent transactions and also monitor fake accounts when promo is being ran

EasyDetect's machine learning algorithms use classification, random forest and neural networks to identify patterns and typical behaviors behind fraudulent transactions.

The machine learning models can process hundreds or even thousands of approved and declined transactions in order to uncover connections that you may not have been aware of.
