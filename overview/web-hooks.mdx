Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time updates from Dojah. For example, when a verification is completed, an address check fails, or a document analysis is flagged, a notification is received. This ensures your systems can react instantly to user events.

## How Webhooks Work

Once you subscribe to a service, Dojah will send an HTTP (usually a POST or a GET) request to your webhook URL whenever the relevant event occurs. Dojah’s request will include details of the event such as the service type and webhook URL. 

Dojah’s Webhook services allow you to subscribe for webhooks, fetch all subscriptions, and also delete a webhook service.

<Accordion title="Subscribe to a Webhook">
  To start receiving webhooks, make a POST request with the service you want to monitor and the URL where Dojah should send updates. There is also the option of subscribing via the dashboard.



  	<Tabs>
	  <Tab title="From the Dashboard (No Code)">
		  - Go to Developers > Webhooks
		  - Click “Subscribe”
		  - Fill in the form:
		  	- App Name – Select the app you want the webhook tied to
		  	- Webhook URL – Enter the endpoint where Dojah will send events
		  	- Service Name – Choose the service (e.g., KYC Widget, NGN Wallet)
	  </Tab>

	  <Tab title="Via the API">
	    Send a `POST` request to the url below:
	    ```json
	    	{{baseUrl}}api/v1/webhook/subscribe
	    ```

	    Pass the body parameters below:
	    | Parameter | Type       | Description																	|Required	|
		| -------- 	| -----------| -------------																|-----------|
		| `webhook` | `string`     | webhook is the webhook url that allows Dojah to send (i.e “push”) data to your application as soon as an event occurs, Create a Test webhook url on webhook.site. Example https://webhook.site/db8ad2b6-91b6-485b-9761-e546b540ccf6 												|required	|
