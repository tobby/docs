EasyDetect is Dojah’s intelligent fraud engine built to help you detect and stop fraud in real time. 
It analyzes every user event—transactions, loan applications, signups—and returns a verdict:
 **Approve**, **Block**, or **Review**.  

You define the rules (there are also templates to begin with). We apply machine learning. 
Together, they power precise fraud detection with less friction for good users.

#### What It Does

EasyDetect evaluates events using a hybrid decision engine that includes:

- **Your Rules** – Simple or complex logic you create in minutes from the dashboard  
- **Behavioral Analytics** – Understand typical vs. anomalous user behavior over time  
- **ML Risk Scoring** – Learn patterns across accounts, devices, and event histories  
- **Account Profiling** – Track every user across multiple identifiers and flows  

It’s real-time fraud detection with long-term risk intelligence built in.

#### How to Integrate and Use

You can go live with EasyDetect in under an hour. Here's the typical setup flow:

1. **Create a Flow**  
   Define what kind of events you want to monitor (transactions, signups, etc). Each flow acts like a container for rules, signals, and verdicts.

2. **Create Rules**  
   Use the no-code rule builder to configure logic like “flag any new device + amount > ₦1M.” Choose from dozens of data points and operators.

3. **Make a Decision**  
   Choose your preferred action: `block`, `approve`, or `review`. Suspicious events are routed to case management.

4. **Send Events**  
   Send both backfill and live user events via our [API](/fraud/monitoring/live-transactions). Start detecting fraud from day one without retraining time.

5. **Review Flagged Cases**  
   Investigate any event flagged for review via the dashboard. See all context, rules triggered, and user history.

6. **Report and Learn**  
   Export case data, track fraud metrics, and feed insights back into your decision-making.

### Case Management

When EasyDetect flags an event as **Review**, it becomes a Case.

Inside the dashboard:

- Analysts can view **why** the event was flagged (rules, score, risk signals, behavioral analysis)
- Investigate with full **user history**, metadata, and associated accounts
- Decide to **Approve** or **Block**, or escalate for a second opinion
- Add **comments, status, and tags** for internal tracking
- Each decision feeds into the ML model, improving future detection

The Case Management panel is built for fraud teams, it’s not just a log. It’s an interactive command center.

### Account Management

EasyDetect auto-generates a unified risk profile for every user by stitching together identifiers

With each interaction, the profile gets richer, tracking behavioral history, past cases, and dynamic risk scores.

Use the **Accounts tab** in the dashboard to:

- Search for a user across flows  
- View all events linked to them  
- Flag suspicious account clusters  
- See historical risk changes over time  

Perfect for identifying fraud rings or repeat offenders hiding behind new identities.

#### Analysis & Reporting

EasyDetect isn’t just reactive. It helps you learn.

Inside the dashboard, you’ll find:

- **Flow-level performance metrics** – Events by verdict, by rule, by status  
- **Top triggered rules** – See what logic is catching the most fraud  
- **Case resolution trends** – Track review outcomes over time  
- **Export options** – Download case data, verdicts, or full reports  

Use this to fine-tune your rules, update ops playbooks, or show compliance teams how fraud is being mitigated.
