Track and assess payment events of any kind—from airtime and utility top-ups to card transactions and wallet transfers. 
EasyDetect’s payment monitoring engine analyzes behavioral signals, payment metadata, and 
device context to flag suspicious or high-risk activity before it impacts your platform.

Whether it's card fraud, SIM manipulation, or unusual VAS payment patterns, 
EasyDetect delivers an immediate verdict: Allowed, Pending, or Blocked.

#### How It Works

When you send a banking event to EasyDetect, the system immediately performs a multi-signal risk analysis. It evaluates:

- **Transaction details** like amount, currency, channel, and purpose  
- **User profile signals**, including account age, balance, registration time, and device consistency  
- **Channel-specific logic** tailored to VAS payments, airtime, card, or wallet transfers  
- **Cross-referencing** with past behavior, known fraud databases, and velocity rules  

In milliseconds, EasyDetect returns one of three decisions:

- ✅ **Allowed** – The transaction is safe to proceed
- ⚠️ **Pending** – The transaction is flagged for manual review in the Case Management tab
- ❌ **Blocked** – The transaction should be stopped immediately

These verdicts give you operational flexibility, 
automate decisions for low-risk events and review edge cases with full context.

#### Step-by-Step Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Flow">
    Log in to the Dojah Dashboard. Under EasyDetect, create a new fraud flow and select "Banking" as your use case. You can name it something like “Customer Transfers” or “Wallet Payouts.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Rules">
   Use our rule builder to define fraud logic without writing code. Examples:  
   - IF amount > 50,000 AND country = X → Mark as Pending  
   - IF airtime purchase repeated 3x in 1 minute → Block  
   - IF same device used for multiple users → Mark as High Risk
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Events">
     Push your transaction data via POST to the
      unique ingestion [URL](/fraud/monitoring/live-transactions#ingest-url) provided in your flow’s settings. 
      Ensure the `type` is set to `banking` and include relevant details like 
      transaction metadata, user profile, device, and recipient.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Receive Decisions in Real-Time">
     Your system receives an instant verdict. Based on the result, you can:  
   - Approve and proceed  
   - Hold for review in the dashboard  
   - Block entirely  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Cases (if needed)">
     Suspicious events will automatically generate a case with all contextual data and rule triggers. Analysts can manually review and take action.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Report and Optimize">
     Use the reporting tab to analyze fraud trends, triggered rules, and verdict history. Iterate on your rule sets for better outcomes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### What We Catch

EasyDetect flags more than static values. Here are a few fraud patterns it detects:

- Rapid airtime/data recharge loops  
- Wallet-to-wallet fraud rings  
- Suspicious transfers to flagged accounts  
- Multiple failed VAS attempts from same device  
- High-value utility or POS transactions from new accounts  

<Note>You can configure who receives email alerts for case review.</Note>

#### Use Cases

- **Fintech Wallets** – Monitor wallet credits, top-ups, and withdrawals  
- **VAS Providers** – Secure airtime, utility, and bill payments  
- **Checkout Platforms** – Review digital payment activity across users  
- **Payment Processors** – Add fraud insights to bank/card flow monitoring

#### Why It Works

Most fraud isn’t just about what’s being paid. It’s about **how, where, and when**. EasyDetect captures those patterns in real time. You get a verdict in milliseconds, can review flagged events manually, and constantly evolve your rules through the dashboard.
