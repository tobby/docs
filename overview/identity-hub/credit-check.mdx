Credit Check enables businesses, especially those in the financial services and lending sectors, to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals with speed and accuracy. The tool offers a centralized dashboard where businesses can initiate and manage credit assessments, view detailed credit insights, and access supporting KYC data.

Through a seamless process, users can start a credit check by entering a customer's BVN or by generating a secure, shareable link that allows customers to submit their own details. This flexibility ensures that businesses can adapt to various onboarding and assessment workflows.
