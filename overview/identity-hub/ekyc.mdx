The eKYC service enables seamless and secure identity verification through Dojah’s widget. It allows businesses to verify the identities of their users by leveraging official government records and biometric authentication. Users simply provide their personal information and upload necessary documents or selfies, while the widget handles the verification process in real time. All eKYC services must be done via the Identity verification widget.

## Features include:

### 1. Government Data Verification

Verify user-submitted information against government databases using biometric matching and document validation. Government data verification includes:


  <Accordion title="Validate BVN">
   Match the user’s identity with their Bank Verification Number (BVN)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="BVN + Selfie Verification">
    Confirms the user’s identity by matching their Bank Verification Number (BVN) with a submitted selfie image
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="NIN + Selfie Verification">
    Validates a user’s National Identification Number (NIN) using face biometrics for added accuracy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="vNIN + Selfie Verification">
    Supports verification using the virtual NIN (vNIN), enhancing privacy while ensuring authenticity through selfie validation.
	**Please Note:** Confidence value is used to verify match and values below 80 are considered false.

	- The NIN holder can generate their virtual NIN via the NIMC Mobile App or the NIMC USSD code - 3463_NIN_EnterpriseCode#.

	- Dojah’s Enterprise code - 1138183

	- The generated VNIN is valid for only 72 hours

	- The vNIN is designed to replace the 11-digit NIN for everyday usage. It is a unique 16-character alphanumeric token comprising 12 digits, sandwiched between 4 alphabets, two on each end, with no correlation to the issuer’s Raw NIN. An example of a vNIN is: AB012345678910YZ.

	- According to NIMC, The VNIN is not to be stored in any database but only used for verifying the NIN holder.
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Age Verification">
    Checks the user’s age from the provided government ID to determine eligibility for age-restricted service
  </Accordion>
 



### 2. Photo ID + Selfie Verification
Allows users to upload a photo of their ID along with a selfie. The system matches the face on the ID to the selfie image to confirm that the person submitting the ID is the rightful owner.
**Please Note:** Confidence value is used to verify a match, and a confidence value of 60 and above shows a successful match; otherwise, it is a mismatch.

### 3. Liveness Check

Uses advanced liveness detection to ensure the selfie is taken in real time by a live person, not a photo or screenshot. This step strengthens the anti-fraud mechanism of the verification flow.
