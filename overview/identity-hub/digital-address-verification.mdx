The address verification process supports both digital and physical verification methods to help businesses confirm the legitimacy of user-provided addresses. 

Digital address verification confirms a user’s physical presence at their stated address by capturing their live location, validating the typed address, and collecting a recent utility bill as supporting evidence. This method is ideal for fast, remote checks. 

Physical address verification allows users to submit their address alongside images of their actual location, which will then be manually reviewed.
