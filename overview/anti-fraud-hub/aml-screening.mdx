The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Screening system is a comprehensive compliance solution that enables businesses to detect and prevent financial crimes by screening individuals and entities against global watchlists, sanctions lists, and politically exposed person (PEP) databases. It provides an integrated workflow that supports everything from instant identity checks to deeper investigative processes, ensuring regulatory compliance and risk oversight at every stage of the customer lifecycle.

This advanced system allows compliance analysts to perform real-time customer lookups and seamlessly transition into full case investigations when potential risks are detected. Each screening result can evolve into a structured case, giving teams the tools to assign ownership, track investigation stages, add internal comments, and document findings in a controlled, traceable environment. Every step in the process is logged, creating a robust audit trail that supports accountability and meets regulatory expectations.

Cases follow a defined lifecycle, moving through stages such as open, in review, escalated, and closed. Analysts can collaborate on cases, tag team members, and record final decisions along with reasons and supporting evidence. These capabilities allow teams to investigate high-risk individuals thoroughly, reduce false positives efficiently, and respond to alerts in a manner that is both timely and well-documented.

The AML Screening system also supports ongoing monitoring and integration with external systems via secure APIs. This allows businesses to automate parts of their compliance process, receive updates when a user reappears on a watchlist, and maintain real-time alignment with evolving regulatory requirements.
