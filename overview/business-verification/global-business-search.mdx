Dojah’s Global Business Check lets you search and verify registered companies across multiple countries using official commercial registries and authoritative data sources. Whether you’re onboarding international merchants, vendors, or partners, this tool helps you stay compliant while reducing risk.

#### What It Does

- **Search by Business Name or Registration Number**  
  Look up companies using partial or full names and get a list of matches. This helps you identify the correct entity, even with minimal information.

- **View Official Company Details**  
  Once you’ve identified the business, you can retrieve detailed information including registration number, company status, address, incorporation date, and director information—directly from government and regulatory sources.

#### Use Cases

- Onboard international merchants, partners, and vendors  
- Perform KYB (Know Your Business) checks across borders  
- Validate foreign company details during due diligence  
- Automate global business verification in your onboarding flow

#### Coverage

Global Business Check supports searches in major jurisdictions, including the US, UK, EU, Asia, Africa, and more. Our database continuously expands to include more countries and registry systems.

> If a country is not yet supported, you can reach out to our team for roadmap visibility or potential custom inclusion.

#### Integration Options

You can access the Global Business Check directly via the **[API](/docs/globalverification/businesscheck/global-business-search)**. Results are returned in real-time and can be embedded into your own dashboards, onboarding forms, or case management tools.
