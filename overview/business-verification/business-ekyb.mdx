eKYB (Know Your Business) via document upload allows you to 
verify the legitimacy of a business entity by collecting and analyzing 
their corporate documents. Instead of relying solely on database lookups 
like CAC or TIN, this method lets you validate documents directly from the business.

Dojah’s eKYB engine extracts and cross-checks submitted document data, such as 
business name, RC number, type, and date of registration, against trusted
 government or regulatory records.

This method is ideal for onboarding businesses where lookups may be insufficient or incomplete.

#### How It Works 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document Upload">
   Users submit official documents such as:
   - CAC certificate
   - Proof of business address (e.g., utility bill)
   - Optional: other corporate identifiers or tax documents
   
   These can be set from the EasyOnboard [configuration](/guides/identity/easyonboard/flow/configure-flow).
  </Step>

<Step title="Document Parsing"> 
  The system uses OCR and AI to:
- Extract business name, RC number, type, and registration date
- Normalize and structure the data
- Check for file quality, clarity, and forgery indicators
</Step>

<Step title="Verification & Match">
The extracted data is:
- Automatically matched against known CAC structures or cross-validated with other verification steps (e.g., TIN)
- Flagged for review if mismatches or incomplete data are detected
- Returned with status labels
</Step>

</Steps>

#### When to Use

- The business does not have an RC number yet or is recently registered

- You need to collect multiple documents for compliance review

- You want to consolidate CAC, TIN, and address checks into a single flow
