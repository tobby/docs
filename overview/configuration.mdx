Before you start making requests to Dojah, you’ll need to configure your project with the right credentials, environment, and integration method. This section walks you through the setup process, whether you're building with APIs, SDKs, or directly from the dashboard.

## Authentication

Every request to platform must be authenticated using your API Secret Key and App ID.

You’ll receive:
- **Secret Key**: Used on the backend for authentication
- **Public Key**: Used only on the frontend (e.g., in SDKs/widgets)
- **App ID**: A unique identifier for your app instance

<Danger>Never expose your secret key on the frontend.</Danger>
