  Every new account is automatically set up in Sandbox mode, giving you instant access to:
   - API Keys for testing
   - Mock access for identity and fraud verification
   - Our dashboard to explore workflows, rules, and reports

   **No approval is needed to explore the sandbox environment.**

	To create an account, please reach out to sales@dojah.io to get started.

  To move to **Live mode** and start verifying real users or monitoring actual transactions, your business must first be verified by our Compliance team.

    **Here's how:**

    1. Log into the Dashboard
    2. Click on “Complete Verification” on the settings tab
    3. Upload the required documentation, including:
    	- Certificate of Incorporation or Business Registration
    	- Valid means of identification for a company director
    	- Additional documents as requested based on your region or use case
    4. Our Compliance team will review and notify you via email (usually within 24–72 hours)
    Once approved, you'll gain access to:

	    - **Live API Keys**
	    - **Production environment**
	    - **Real-time data and user actions**
  </Card>
