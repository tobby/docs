Banking events represent account activities that involve storing or moving funds. These activities require continuous monitoring to detect account takeover attempts, mule behavior, and other high-risk financial interactions.

ProfiledRisk evaluates each banking event using both:

-   **User-configured rules** (Flows)
    
-   **ProfiledRisk intelligence** (behavioral and contextual scoring)  
      
    

Each evaluation returns an operational decision via the status field:

-   **allowed** — event can proceed
    
-   **blocked** — event should be stopped
    
-   **pending** — event requires manual review before continuing
    

This ensures good users move forward quickly while high-risk actions are held or stopped.

  

## **When To Use This Use Case**

Use the **Banking** category when processing:

-   Deposit requests
    
-   Withdrawal requests
    
-   Wallet-to-wallet or account-to-account transfers
    
-   Bill payments and other value transactions
    
-   Security-sensitive account actions, including password or PIN updates
    

If an action can affect stored value, evaluate it as a Banking event.

  

## **Expected Event Inputs**

A Banking event should include signals that describe:

**Category**

**Example Fields**

**Purpose**

Transaction details

amount, currency, type, channel, purpose, time

Identifies financial behavior and velocity changes

Profile details

user\_id, tier, account type, registration time

Establishes identity history and entitlement levels

Counterparty details

sender, receiver account metadata

Detects laundering or high-risk corridors

Device & network

device\_id, IP, model, OS

Detects account takeover and device sharing

Additional metadata

meta array

Business-specific flags and labels

The full JSON schema and field definitions are documented [here](https://docs.dojah.services/s/PT/p/api-integration-Am73mLL388)

ProfiledRisk will use all available fields to build risk context over time.

  

## **Decisioning Logic**

Each Banking event is evaluated through:

1.  **Your Flows**  
    Rules configured in the dashboard using conditions such as amount thresholds, country restrictions, new devices, etc.  
      
    
2.  **System Intelligence**
    
    -   User’s historical transaction behavior
        
    -   Device and IP history
        
    -   Geographic consistency
        
    -   Counter-party patterns
        
    -   Interaction velocity
        

The outcome returns:

    {
      "status": "blocked",
      "risk_score": 87,
      "risk_level": "high",
      "case_created": true
    }

Your system can enforce the response:

**Status**

**Required Action from Client System**

**allowed**

Complete the transaction normally

**blocked**

Do not process; optionally notify the user

**pending**

Hold and send to Case review before processing

When a case is created, ProfiledRisk retains event details for analyst decisioning.

  

## **Case Creation**

A Case may be created when:

-   A rule instructs that additional verification is required
    
-   System intelligence cannot determine clear fraud vs. legitimate behavior
    
-   The returned status is **pending**  
      
    

Cases are visible in the dashboard with complete contextual information including user profile, device history, and linked transactions.

Analysts may confirm or overturn automation, and decisions may be used to refine rules over time.

  

## **Example Flow Rules**

Below are common rule patterns for Banking events:

**Scenario**

**Flow Condition**

**Returned Status**

Account takeover indicators

New device + password changed recently + high withdrawal amount

blocked

Suspicious cash-out pattern

3+ unrelated incoming transfers followed by immediate withdrawals

pending

High-risk recipient

First-time beneficiary in restricted region

pending

Abnormal activity from dormant profile

No activity for extended period then large transfers

blocked

Rule sets can be expanded and tuned based on operational policy.

  

## **Summary**

ProfiledRisk helps protect banking operations by:

-   Preventing unauthorized account access and withdrawals
    
-   Detecting mule activity and laundering flows
    
-   Routing uncertain activity to human review before funds move
    
-   Reducing operational workload through automated decisioning
    

This use case is essential when handling any banking actions that involve changes to stored value or account integrity.
