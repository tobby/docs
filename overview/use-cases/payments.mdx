Payment events represent value-moving activities processed through cards, transfers, USSD, POS, or mobile channels. Because these transactions often settle immediately or trigger downstream risk exposure, they require real-time decisioning.

ProfiledRisk evaluates each payment event using:

-   **User-configured rules** in your Flows
    
-   **ProfiledRisk intelligence**, including behavioral and velocity scoring  
      
    

The returned decision is provided in the response status field:

-   **allowed** — payment may proceed
    
-   **blocked** — payment must not proceed
    
-   **pending** — payment is held pending analyst review
    

This ensures rapid authorization for trusted customers while blocking or pausing suspicious payment attempts.

  

## **When to Use This Use Case**

Use the **Payments** category when:

-   A user initiates a financial purchase or transfer
    
-   A card or stored payment method is used
    
-   A payment is attempted from a device or location
    
-   A request requires authorization from a payment processor or partner network
    

Examples include:

-   Card payments (online, mobile, POS)
    
-   Wallet funding and withdrawals
    
-   Airtime/data purchases
    
-   Peer-to-peer transfers
    
-   Recurring billing
    

If the event impacts transaction settlement or fraud risk, send it as a Payment event.

  

## **Expected Event Inputs**

A Payment event should provide a unified view across:




| **Category**   | **Example Details**          | **Risk Purpose**                                |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
|  **User**    | Profile/identity, KYC, income, account status    | Trust level, identity stability |
|  **Transaction**    |  Value, channel, frequency, purpose  | Detects behavioral anomalies |
|  **Payment**   | Card scheme, CVV, 3DS, AVS, recurring flag   | Financial instrument validation |
|   **Merchant**    |  Merchant/location/category  | Risk scoring by MCC and geography |
|  **Device**     |   device\_id, IP, OS  | Account takeover and device sharing signals |
|  **Billing Address**     | street, city, country   | AVS/presence verification |


The JSON schema and validation rules for Payment events are documented [here](/docs/payload-schemas/payment-events).

The more relevant signals provided, the more accurate the risk evaluation.

  

## **Decisioning Logic**

Evaluation combines:

### **1\. Your Flows**

Configured business rules such as:

-   Payment limit thresholds
    
-   Country restrictions
    
-   Card presence and 3DS enforcement
    
-   Device reputation checks  
      
    

### **2\. ProfiledRisk Intelligence**

Continuously updated behavior modeling:

-   Velocity of failed/successful payments
    
-   Unusual channel or merchant changes
    
-   Device or geo inconsistency with historical behavior
    
-   Risky merchant categories or stacks
    
-   Sudden spike in high-value transactions  
      
    

The output decision structure is:

      "status": "blocked",
      "risk_score": 91,
      "risk_level": "high",
      "case_created": true

Your system can enforce the response:

**Status**

**Client Enforcement**

**allowed**

Continue and authorize payment

**blocked**

Stop transaction and optionally notify user

**pending**

Hold payment for analyst validation before settlement

  

## **Case Management**

A Case is created automatically when:

-   Flow rules mark the payment as requiring review
    
-   System intelligence finds new anomalies that require human assessment
    
-   Returned status is **pending**
    
      
    

Analysts can evaluate:

-   Payment history
    
-   Merchant and counterparty exposure
    
-   Device/IP consistency
    
-   Rule triggers and scores
    

Their decision can then be written back into operational flows.

  

## **Example Payment Rules**

Common configurations used by payment providers and fintechs:

**Objective**

**Rule Concept**

**Returned Status**

Prevent stolen card use

CVV missing OR 3DS disabled AND high-risk merchant

blocked

Detect account takeover

First-time large purchase + new device + newly changed password/PIN

blocked

Catch friendly fraud attempts

Dispute history + recurring transaction retry + high-risk MCC

pending

Control risky corridors

Merchant country ≠ profile history + high-value

pending

Catch high-velocity fraud

Multiple declined attempts across merchants in 5 minutes

blocked

All rule logic can be tuned per risk tolerance and regulatory obligations.

  

## **Summary**

ProfiledRisk supports safe and scalable payment operations by ensuring:

-   Real-time authorization decisions with clear enforcement signals
    
-   Strong defense against card abuse, mule behavior, and takeover-driven payments
    
-   Lower chargebacks and fraud losses
    
-   Minimal friction for trusted customers
    
-   Better analyst efficiency with automated segmentation
    
      
    

This use case should be utilized for any transaction where rapid, accurate risk evaluation is required prior to settlement.
