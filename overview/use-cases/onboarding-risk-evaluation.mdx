title: Onboarding Risk Evaluation
icon: "file"
---

Onboarding events represent the first point of interaction between a user and your product. Evaluating risk at this stage prevents hostile accounts, synthetic identities, and automated fraud from ever entering the system.

ProfiledRisk analyzes onboarding data in real time using:

-   **User-configured rules** that determine acceptable onboarding behavior
    
-   **ProfiledRisk intelligence** that learns from historical fraud patterns and behavior models
    

Each onboarding event returns a decision via the status field:

-   **allowed** — user onboarding can continue normally
    
-   **blocked** — onboarding must not proceed
    
-   **pending** — additional verification or analyst intervention required
    

This ensures quality acquisition while preventing high-risk accounts from progressing.

  

## **When to Use This Use Case**

Use the **Onboarding** category when:

-   A new account is created (signup)
    
-   User profile data is updated during onboarding (tier upgrade, identity submission)
    
-   A risk-relevant interaction is triggered before account approval
    
-   Device or KYC changes occur prior to access to financial capabilities  
      
    

Example onboarding triggers:

-   User signs up for the first time
    
-   KYC document submitted
    
-   Mobile or email verified
    
-   First device and IP captured
    

Onboarding events help determine whether a profile should be trusted from the start.

  

## **Expected Event Inputs**

A clear understanding of identity, device, and environment reduces false approvals and improves fraud blocking.

### **Required Signal Groups**

**Category**

**Example Fields**

**Purpose**

**User identity**

name, email, dob, phone

Validate existence and completeness

**KYC attributes**

id type/number, issuing country

Confirm regulatory compliance

**Behavioral context**

registration\_time, tier

Identify rushed or unusual onboarding

**Device & network**

device\_id, OS, IP address

Detect bots, multi-accounting, and takeover attempts

**Location**

user-provided address

Match against risk geography context

ProfiledRisk uses onboarding data to build the initial profile baseline.

  

## **Decisioning Logic**

Evaluation of onboarding events combines:

### **1\. Your Rules**

Examples of such rules are:

-   Require additional checks for high-risk identity types or mismatched details
    
-   Prevent onboarding from VPN/proxy ranges
    
-   Force step-up verification for incomplete or suspicious KYC
    
      
    

### **2\. ProfiledRisk Intelligence**

Signals such as:

-   Email/phone age and uniqueness score
    
-   Device—profile sharing
    
-   IP trust level and geolocation
    
-   Behavior velocity patterns from similar profiles
    
-   Early indicators of synthetic or bot-generated accounts  
      
    

**Response Example**

```json
    {
      "status": "pending",
      "risk_score": 65,
      "risk_level": "medium",
      "case_created": true
    }
```
    

Your system can enforce the response:

**Status**

**Required Action**

allowed

Complete onboarding step

blocked

Stop onboarding and deny access

pending

Request additional validation or manually review

Pending onboarding decisions typically trigger identity step-up flows.

  

## **Case Management**

Cases may be generated during onboarding when:

-   Submitted identity attributes conflict or appear fraudulent
    
-   Device behavior aligns with known attack patterns
    
-   Data is insufficient for reliable risk classification
    
-   Customer rules explicitly require approval workflows (e.g., high-tier enrollment)
    

Analysts can review available evidence such as device fingerprinting, risk factors, and historical entity relationships before confirming or rejecting onboarding.

  

## **Example Onboarding Rules**

**Objective**

**Flow Rule Concept**

**Returned Status**

Reduce bot signups

Device seen across multiple unrelated profiles

blocked

Validate KYC compliance

Missing ID details for regulated tiers

pending

Detect synthetic profiles

Identity fields mismatch with country data model

blocked

Control registration risk

Signups from high-risk IP geolocations

pending

These rules can be expanded and tuned continuously as fraud patterns evolve.

  

## **Summary**

ProfiledRisk enhances onboarding by:

-   Preventing fraudulent actors before they gain access
    
-   Reducing regulatory and operational exposure early in the lifecycle
    
-   Enabling step-up checks only when needed
    
-   Giving visibility into device, IP, and identity signal quality
    

This enables high-confidence account creation while maintaining streamlined onboarding for genuine users.
