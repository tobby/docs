A Currency Transaction Report (CTR) is a regulatory filing required when a transaction or set of related transactions meets or exceeds a legally defined monetary threshold. CTRs support anti-money laundering oversight by ensuring large cash movements are recorded and made available to regulators.

ProfiledRisk automatically prepares CTR documentation when reportable transactions are detected through real-time risk monitoring and rule enforcement.

## **When CTRs Are Generated in ProfiledRisk**

CTRs are generated when a **cash-related transaction** meets configured criteria. These can include:

-   A **single transaction** exceeding a defined monetary limit
    
-   **Multiple smaller transactions** aggregated within a time window that collectively exceed the limit
    
-   Any behavior pattern identified as a **structuring attempt** to avoid reporting thresholds
    

Threshold rules are configurable per jurisdiction, allowing organizations to align CTR triggers with local legislation.

Typical triggers include:

-   High-value deposit or withdrawal
    
-   Large physical cash transaction via POS, agent, or ATM
    
-   Multiple cash loads within a defined timeframe
    

Events flagged for CTR **do not automatically imply suspicion** — the filing is driven by transaction size and category.

## **CTR Review and Decision Flow**

1.  Banking or payment event is received
    
2.  Rules and system intelligence assess cash exposure
    
3.  ProfiledRisk flags a CTR requirement when conditions are met
    
4.  CTR is automatically generated and associated with the event
    
5.  Compliance team reviews and downloads the report
    
6.  Filing with regulators is performed manually
    

CTR generation does **not** require a Case or manual suspicion review.

## **What Data Is Included in the CTR**

CTR documents include the full context of the cash activity, such as:

Section

Description

Reporting entity details

Preconfigured compliance contact and organization information

Transaction data

Amount, currency, time, channel, corridor

Actor information

Identity and KYC attributes of the user conducting the transaction

Source/destination data

For inbound/outbound cash handling

Aggregation details

If multiple transactions triggered the CTR

Filing metadata

Unique reference and reporting date

ProfiledRisk consolidates events automatically when aggregation triggers apply.

## **Entity Configuration Requirements**

Before CTRs can be generated, organizations must configure:

-   Reporting organization legal name
    
-   Rendering Entity Code
    
-   Branch name/ID/Code
    

These settings are applied consistently to all future CTR exports.

## **Accessing CTR Reports**

CTRs are available in the **Reports** dashboard and can be:

✔ Downloaded in regulatory-acceptable formats  
✔ Linked back to originating transactions and user profiles  
✔ Filtered by amount, date range, or operational branch  
✔ Retained and audited for compliance traceability

All reports are locked once generated to preserve the regulatory record.

-   Automating threshold detection and aggregation checks
    
-   Eliminating manual data preparation
    
-   Ensuring consistent reporting across jurisdictions
