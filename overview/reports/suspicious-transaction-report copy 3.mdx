A Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a documented record submitted to regulatory authorities when a transaction, activity, or behavior pattern suggests potential money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any illegal financial conduct. ProfiledRisk provides automated STR preparation to support regulatory compliance obligations while reducing manual documentation work.

STRs in ProfiledRisk are generated directly from verified suspicious activity identified during monitoring and case review.

## **How STR Generation Works in ProfiledRisk**

STR creation is driven by **confirmed suspicion**, not thresholds alone. A transaction must be reviewed and classified as suspicious before an STR is generated.

STR workflows follow this sequence:

1.  A transaction or profile event triggers a **pending** status
    
    -   Based on a rule condition
        
    -   Or detected by ProfiledRisk intelligence
        
2.  A **Case** is automatically created for investigation
    
3.  An analyst reviews the event, its context, and supporting intelligence
    
4.  Analyst marks the Case as **Suspicious**
    
    -   This permanently flags the event
        
    -   System locks all related data for audit integrity
        
5.  ProfiledRisk automatically generates a **Suspicious Transaction Report**
    
6.  The STR becomes available in the **Reports** section for download
    

ProfiledRisk does **not** submit STRs to regulators. Customers are responsible for filing through their licensed compliance process.

## **What Data Is Included in the STR**

The STR format used by ProfiledRisk is aligned with common regulatory reporting structures based on the templates you provided.

The report contains:

Section

Description

**Report Details**

Filing reference, date of report generation, report type

**Reporting Entity Information**

Entity name, registration number, compliance contact, reporting branch

**Subject Information**

Customer identity and profile attributes, risk indicators

**Transaction Information**

Amount, date, channel, payment instrument, counterparties

**Suspicion Indicators**

Rules and intelligence that triggered suspicion

**Narrative Summary**

Analyst explanation supporting the suspicion classification

**Attachments**

Evidence such as linked transactions or profile changes

ProfiledRisk automatically populates available data fields captured through Events and Cases.

  

## **Entity Configuration Requirements**

Before STRs can be generated, compliance-related organization details must be configured in the Dashboard:

-   Reporting organization legal name
    
-   Rendering Entity Code
    
-   Branch name/ID/Code
    

Once set, ProfiledRisk applies these values consistently to every STR.

## **Accessing STR Reports**

All STRs are accessible within the **Reports** module of the Dashboard.

Each report can be:

✔ Downloaded as a structured PDF or machine-readable file (JSON/CSV)  
✔ Linked to the original Case and underlying events  
✔ Exported for internal compliance and audit review  
✔ Filtered by date range, transaction value, or risk level

Reports are immutable once generated — ProfiledRisk maintains the original record for audit trails.

## **Analyst Responsibilities**

While ProfiledRisk automates detection, data population, formatting, and record keeping, analysts remain responsible for:

-   Assessing whether suspicion is justified
    
-   Adding narrative context to support suspicion claims
    
-   Ensuring timely filing with the correct regulator
    
-   Providing supplemental information if requested by oversight bodies
    

ProfiledRisk enforces accountability by requiring the **analyst identity** to be attached to each STR generated.

## **Summary**

STR reporting in ProfiledRisk ensures:

-   Faster regulatory response to suspicious activity
    
-   Accurate record keeping driven by real event data
    
-   Full traceability between Cases, Events, and Reports
    
-   Clear division of responsibility between automation and human oversight
    
-   Reliable exports that meet compliance standards
    

STR automation reduces reporting friction while maintaining regulatory quality and traceability across the entire risk lifecycle.
