A **Profile Report** provides a complete view of an individual entity’s identity, behavioural signals, transaction patterns, and associated risk posture. It is designed for internal fraud analysts, compliance officers, and support investigators who need a consolidated and exportable record of a customer’s lifecycle activity within your system.

This report can be generated on-demand from any profile in the dashboard.

  

## Purpose

Use the Profile Report to:

-   Support **KYC/AML investigations**
    
-   Review a user’s historical behaviour prior to **case resolution**
    
-   Assess customer trustworthiness when approving **high-risk actions**
    
-   Aid compliance documentation for **regulators** or **external auditors**
    
-   Provide dispute support with concrete evidence trails

### 1\. Profile Summary
