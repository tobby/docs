A Fraud Transaction Report (FTR) is a regulatory filing that documents transaction activity confirmed as fraudulent. The purpose of the FTR is to notify authorities and support ecosystem-level intervention against fraud rings, money mule networks, and organized criminal activity.

ProfiledRisk automates the creation of these reports once fraud is validated through investigation.

  

## **When FTRs Are Generated in ProfiledRisk**

FTRs require **confirmed fraud** — not just suspicion.

Triggers include:

-   Analyst marks a Case outcome as **Fraud Confirmed**
    
-   Device and identity correlation reveals proven multi-account abuse
    
-   Merchant or beneficiary involvement is linked to known fraud activity
    
-   Evidence supports consumer protection or regulatory escalation requirements
    

This ensures reports are submitted only after authoritative decision-making.

  

## **Fraud Case Workflow Leading to FTR**

1.  Transaction flagged as **pending** during risk evaluation
    
2.  Case automatically created for investigation
    
3.  Fraud analyst reviews user history, device linkage, and counterparty behavior
    
4.  Analyst assigns the decision **Fraud Confirmed**
    
5.  ProfiledRisk generates an FTR with all relevant evidence
    
6.  Compliance team downloads for regulatory submission
    

Once classified as fraud, data in the case becomes immutable for audit integrity.

  

## **What Is Contained in an FTR**

FTRs document the full scope of the fraudulent flow:

Section

Description

Reporting entity details

Business filing the report and contact responsible

Subject information

Profile details of the user committing or impacted by fraud

Transaction information

Value, time, method, and fraud category

Fraud indicators

Rule triggers and system intelligence with supporting facts

Impact and exposure data

Estimated loss, recovered funds, and related accounts

Case references

Links to profile history and previous investigations

ProfiledRisk ensures a complete and regulator-aligned submission record.

  

## **Entity Configuration Requirements**

Organizations configure the following once:

-   Reporting organization legal name
    
-   Rendering Entity Code
    
-   Branch name/ID/Code
    

These details are automatically applied to every FTR produced.

## **Accessing and Managing FTR Reports**

All FTRs are accessible in the Reports section with:

✔ Filtering by fraud category and affected product  
✔ Download formats for filing or law enforcement requests  
✔ Traceability to events, profiles, and Case reviewer identity  
✔ Permanent audit storage for evidence continuity

  

## **Analyst Responsibilities**

Analysts remain responsible for:

-   Confirming fraudulent activity prior to report creation
    
-   Providing narrative content explaining the fraud classification
    
-   Filing the FTR to the correct agency or law enforcement authority
    

ProfiledRisk ensures the report is accurate — the analyst ensures the action is justified.
