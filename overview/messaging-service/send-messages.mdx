Send high-priority transactional SMS messages to your users 
using Dojah’s Messaging API. Whether it's delivering 
payment confirmations, or onboarding alerts, messages are routed instantly with full
 visibility into delivery status.

#### How It Works

Before you can start sending messages, you must register a Sender ID—this is the alphanumeric name that appears as the sender (e.g., DOJAH, MYBANK). You can request a Sender ID via the Dojah Dashboard. Once approved, it becomes available for use in your API calls.

**To send a message**:

- Register and activate your Sender ID

- Make a POST request to the messaging endpoint with the recipient’s phone number and message body

- Receive a message_id in response for tracking status

Optionally, poll the status endpoint using the message_id to track delivery lifecycle

**Statuses include**:

- queued – Message is awaiting dispatch

- sent – Message has been handed to the telco

- delivered – Successfully received by the user

- failed – Delivery failed (e.g., invalid number or telco issue)


#### Use Cases

- Payment or wallet transaction alerts

- Loan disbursement or status updates

- Onboarding verification messages

#### Message Status Tracking

Use the GET /status endpoint with the message_id to track the real-time state of any message. This provides a full audit trail across your communication touchpoints and ensures reliability in delivery.
