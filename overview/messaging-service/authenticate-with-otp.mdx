Authenticate users securely using Dojah’s OTP service. 
This API enables you to send time-bound one-time passwords to users’ phone numbers,
 then validate the code when they submit it. It’s ideal for login, signup, 
 transaction confirmation, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

#### How It Works

The OTP process is straightforward:

1. **Send OTP**  
   Make a POST request to the `send-otp` [endpoint](/docs/messaging/send-otp) with the user’s phone number. A 6-digit code is generated and sent via SMS using your registered Sender ID.

2. **User Inputs OTP**  
   The user enters the code they received.

3. **Validate OTP**  
   Make a POST request to the `validate-otp` [endpoint](/docs/messaging/validate-otp) with the phone number and the code. If valid and not expired, you’ll receive a success response.

Each OTP is valid for a limited time and can only be used once. You can also set your preferred OTP expiration time and resend behavior.
