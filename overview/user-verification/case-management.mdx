title: Case Management

---

Review and manage all verification attempts from a central dashboard—whether 
they passed automatically, failed, or require human review. 
The Case Management view helps you stay in control of onboarding decisions, 
flag potential fraud, and take action on users who fall into manual review workflows.

#### How Case Management Works

Once a user completes a verification flow, their result is logged and accessible in the Verifications section of the EasyOnboard dashboard.

Every case is tagged with a status, metadata, 
and supporting evidence (documents, selfies, match scores, fraud signals). 
Based on your flow configuration, verifications may be auto-approved, auto-declined, or marked for manual review.

#### Where to Manage Verifications

To access and review all user verifications:

1. Go to the Dojah Dashboard

2. Navigate to **EasyOnboard > Verifications**

3. You will see a list of all verification attempts. Each entry includes a timestamp, reference ID, flow name, and current status

4. Click on any row to open the detailed case view, where you can inspect documents, biometrics, and take action if needed

If you are using **webhooks**, you will also receive real time updates whenever a user completes their flow, fails a verification, or gets flagged for review. This allows you to automate next steps, such as activating an account or pausing a transaction, based on live verification outcomes.

#### When Manual Review is Triggered

Dojah’s system will automatically route verifications to manual review under any of the following conditions:

- A step is marked as "Review Required" in the flow configuration

- A fraud check triggers a pending status

- Liveness or face match confidence score falls below the minimum threshold

- An internal flag from custom lists, blacklist match, or velocity rule triggers an alert

***

#### Human Review by Dojah

In cases where automated systems cannot confidently determine the outcome of a verification (especially during document analysis), Dojah’s internal verification team can step in for secondary validation.

This is helpful when:

- OCR fails to extract readable data from IDs

- Document tampering detection is inconclusive

Dojah’s team may approve, reject, or escalate a case based on additional inspection. All actions are recorded in the case log for compliance and traceability.

#### Actions You Can Take

From the case view, your team can:

- Approve or reject a verification manually

- Add internal comments for audit trails

- Download submitted files (e.g., documents, selfies)

- Search or filter verifications by status, date, flow name, or user reference

- Export records for compliance, audit, or reporting
