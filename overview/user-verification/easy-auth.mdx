EasyAuth lets you re-authenticate users quickly using a reference ID and liveness verification, without asking them to go through the full ID verification process again.

It can work as part of your EasyOnboard flow or be used independently when all you need is to confirm a returning user is still who they claim to be.

***

#### What It Solves

Users shouldn’t need to re-upload documents or 
fill out forms again just to perform high-risk actions like 
logging in from a new device or initiating a large transaction.

EasyAuth gives you a frictionless re-authentication 
layer, secure enough for compliance, 
fast enough for a good user experience.


***

#### How EasyAuth Works

- You trigger EasyAuth using a Reference ID, this ID must be tied to a user who has previously completed liveness verification via EasyOnboard or EasyAuth.

- The user is prompted to perform a quick liveness check, no ID input or document upload is needed.

- The system matches the new liveness result against the stored reference.

- A verification result is sent to your webhook endpoint, and is also available on the EasyAuth dashboard.

***

#### Reference ID Requirements

To use EasyAuth, the reference ID must:

- Be tied to a successful verification that included liveness

- Be retrievable from either the EasyOnboard Verifications Dashboard or the EasyAuth Customers Dashboard


<Note>If the user hasn’t completed liveness before, 
you can onboard them directly via EasyAuth using a liveness-only flow. </Note>

#### When to Use EasyAuth

Use EasyAuth when you need to:

- Let returning users perform sensitive actions without repeating onboarding

- Add a secure checkpoint before transactions or account recovery

- Re-authenticate users after a session timeout or unusual behavior

- Confirm biometric presence in a streamlined flow
