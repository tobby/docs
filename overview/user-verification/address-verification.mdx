Address verification helps confirm a user's physical or digital location to ensure that the address they provide is legitimate. Dojah supports both digital and physical address verification flows, giving you flexibility based on your use case.

You can use either option standalone or combine both methods for more robust verification.

***

#### Digital Address Verification

Digital address verification is a lightweight, fast method to confirm where your users are currently located, without needing to send agents or rely on physical checks.

You can enable digital address capture directly within the eKYC widget:

- Users provide their current address via the form

- Dojah detects their live GPS location and matches it with the entered address

- You can also allow users to upload house images or utility bills as extra validation

This flow is ideal for remote onboarding, fast KYC checks, or hybrid address screening

<Note>
You can configure digital address collection and matching rules directly in your EasyOnboard flow [here](https://app.dojah.io/easy-onboard)

#### Physical Address Verification

Physical address verification offers an on-ground review of a user’s stated location. This is especially useful for higher-risk cases, regulatory compliance, or verifying business locations.

There are two types of physical address checks you can perform with Dojah:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Address Verification">
   Dojah assigns a field agent to visit the user’s address and confirm:

    - That the address exists and is valid

    - That the user is physically present or can be identified at the location

    - That any utility bills or supporting documents are legitimate

    Agents collect GPS coordinates, house images, and additional comments.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Business Address Verification">
   Designed for corporate clients, vendors, or merchants. Dojah verifies:

    - The business signage, office premises, and activity

    - Supporting documents like CAC certificates or tax records

    - Presence of real staff or signage at the claimed location

You can initiate this check for onboarding suppliers, vendors, or businesses in regulated industries.

#### Combine Both Methods for Stronger Accuracy

You can layer digital and physical address checks to reduce fraud risk:

- Start with digital collection using eKYC and location matching

- Add a physical verification step based on risk profile or transaction limits

- Review uploaded utility bills or house photos
