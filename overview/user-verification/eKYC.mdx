title: About eKYC

---

eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) is a digital process for verifying user identity using a combination of government data, biometrics, and document verification. With Dojah, you can run end-to-end eKYC flows that meet regulatory requirements without adding friction to your onboarding experience.

Whether you're onboarding customers for financial services, lending, wallets, or mobility platforms, our eKYC flow ensures identity validation, fraud prevention, and compliance in one integrated pipeline.

### What’s Included in an eKYC Flow:

Dojah’s eKYC stack is modular and can be configured to match your risk level, industry, and regulatory needs.

### How to integrate

Dojah’s eKYC process is built around pre-configured flows. Once you define your verification steps from the dashboard, you can trigger the flow using either the SDK or a verification link.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the flow">
   From the Dojah dashboard, define what pages your eKYC flow should include. 
   You can set up multiple flows for different use cases (e.g., low-risk vs. high-risk onboarding).

   <Note>See how to configure a flow [here](/guides/identity/easyonboard/flow/create-flow)</Note>

</Step>

  <Step title="Choose How to Trigger the Flow">
	1. **Verification Link**

	Generate a unique flow URL for each user. 
	You can send this link whichever you prefer, e.g from your internal dashboard. Users can easily complete the entire eKYC process in a browser

	How to Generate Verification Links [here](/guides/identity/easyonboard/integration)


	2. **SDK Integration**

	Embed the flow directly into your app using the Dojah SDK. The SDK handles:

	- UI rendering
	- Step-by-step Capture
	- Submission and result handling
	- View Results via the dashboard or via webhooks

#### When to Use eKYC
- Remote onboarding
Verify users quickly. Reduce drop-offs and automate identity checks.

- Regulatory compliance
Meet KYC/AML obligations across fintech, crypto, and payments. Keep your processes audit-ready.

- Fraud prevention
Catch fake identities before they enter your system. Block impersonation, duplicates, and recycled data.

- Re-verification
Confirm identity during high-risk actions like PIN resets or device changes. Add biometric checkpoints when it matters.

- Platform safety
Build trust in user activities. Use eKYC to protect reputation and prevent abuse.
