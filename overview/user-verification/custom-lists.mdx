title: Custom Lists

---

Custom Lists let you upload your own internal list of users, identifiers, or countries that should be flagged during verification. Once uploaded, the system automatically compares incoming user data against the list and applies your defined outcome when a match is found.

***

#### How It Works:

- Create a list of high-risk values—this could include phone numbers, email addresses, device IDs, countries, or any specific data point you want to block or flag.

- Upload the list via the dashboard.

- Then the system flags against the list uploaded.

***

#### What You Can Flag

- Specific users (via email, phone number, or user ID)

- Countries or regions you do not want to onboard from

- Known fraud patterns tied to device fingerprints, IPs, etc.

- Repeat offenders or previously blocked identities

***

#### Example Use Case

You maintain a CSV file of blocked phone numbers from users who have previously committed fraud or abandoned onboarding.
Upload the file and configure the system to mark any matching submission as failed.


#### Why It Matters

Custom Lists give you direct control over who gets flagged based on your own intelligence, not just what Dojah detects by default. It's the easiest way to enforce internal risk policies at scale.
