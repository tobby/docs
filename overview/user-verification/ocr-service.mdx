The Generic OCR Service allows you to extract structured text and field-level data from virtually 
any type of document, even if it’s not a standard ID or form. This is 
useful when working with files like utility bills, handwritten documents, 
bank statements, or any scanned paper that contains useful data.

Whether it’s text-heavy, printed, or partially handwritten, 
the OCR engine reads and returns usable data in a clean, structured format.


***

#### What It Does

- Accepts document uploads (images or PDFs)

- Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract readable content

- Returns both raw text and structured key-value data

- Supports multiple languages and document layouts

You can upload anything, from a filled-out physical form to a scanned multi-page document, and receive both unstructured and parsed outputs.


***

#### Common Use Cases

Use the Generic OCR Service when you need to:

- Parse bank statements, utility bills, invoices, or receipts

- Digitize handwritten or scanned documents

- Extract details from KYC documents that are not government-issued

- Pre-process form submissions for backend automation

This tool is especially helpful in onboarding, document analysis, or compliance workflows that require supplementary documents beyond standard IDs.

***

#### When to Use It

- When you don’t need identity verification but still want to read and use document data

- When your verification flow includes uploads like proof of address, income, or tax records

- When you're processing documents submitted outside of EasyOnboard and need a flexible reader

- As a fallback when standard document verification does not support a specific file format or region
