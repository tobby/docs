title: Face Match

---

Face Match is a biometric comparison check that determines whether a selfie or live image matches the photo on a government-issued ID. It’s a critical step in confirming document ownership and detecting impersonation attempts during onboarding, account recovery, or high-trust actions.

Dojah’s face match engine compares facial embeddings from two sources:

- A selfie or liveness-captured image

- A document photo (from ID, passport, or license)

The system returns a match result, confidence score, and fallback signals to guide your decision flow.

### How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Image Capture">
    You capture two images:
    - A selfie (either passive image or from a liveness session)
    - A document photo, usually auto-extracted from a submitted ID
  </Step>
  <Step title="Face Matching">
  Both images are compared using deep-learning models trained to detect fraud, obstructions, and minor facial changes (e.g., hairstyle, glasses).
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Scoring & Result">
    The system returns a boolean match result and a confidence score between 0 and 100. The confidence threshold counts what is as an acceptable match.
  </Step>
</Steps>
