User Screening enables you to assess the trustworthiness of a user in real time by 
pulling signals from their digital footprint: including phone number, 
email address, name, IP, and device metadata. This helps you detect potential fraud 
and assess onboarding risk before proceeding with KYC or financial verification.

The module is ideal for pre-KYC checks, account protection, and risk-based onboarding policies.

#### Core Features


You receive a holistic risk profile for every user, including:

- **Phone Number Intelligence** – Carrier type, line status, SIM change detection, and usage history  
- **Email Risk Signals** – Reputation, breach history, domain analysis, and spam likelihood  
- **Name Analysis** – Frequency and commonality checks, with additional trust scoring where available  
- **IP and Device Metadata** – Country, ISP, VPN/Tor/proxy flags, and device fingerprint insights  
- **Risk Score** – A unified trust score generated from all available signals to guide your decision-making  

This layered insight gives your system enough intelligence to accept, flag, or route a user for deeper verification.
