Dojah’s AML Screening service helps businesses detect and manage 
potential financial crime risks. It checks individuals or businesses against global watchlists
, politically exposed persons (PEPs), sanctions lists, and adverse media sources. 
It’s designed to simplify compliance with KYC, AML, and CFT regulations, without 
adding operational friction.

You can screen users directly from the dashboard or via API, 
review results in real-time, and manage alerts efficiently 
within your internal compliance workflows.

#### Core Features

- **Screening against global databases**: Sanctions lists, PEPs, and watchlists from 
international regulators, including UN, OFAC, and EU.

- **Adverse media monitoring**: Real-time checks for negative mentions across hundreds of news sources.

- **Clear result types**: Categorized as No Match, Partially Matched, Potential Match, or Confirmed Match.

- **Match score**: Each match includes a score from 0–100 to indicate how stringent a search should be.

- **Risk levels**: Flagged profiles are categorized as Low, Medium, or High risk.

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Enable continuous background monitoring for selected entities or users.

#### Case Management

All screenings are logged and presented in an interactive, filterable table where your team can take action:

- View match scores, risk levels, and entity type (individual or business).

- Assign cases to team members, update match statuses, or leave comments.

- Access profile details, including source links and description summaries.

- Download a detailed screening report for audit or compliance records.

- Easily distinguish one-time checks from monitored profiles.
