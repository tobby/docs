IP Screening analyzes a user’s IP address to evaluate fraud risk,
 detect suspicious activity, and flag high-risk sessions. 
 It provides a clear breakdown of geolocation, proxy usage, 
 blacklist history, and anonymity indicators, helping you prevent fraud before it happens.

#### Core Features

You receive a detailed profile for every IP address submitted:

- **Blacklist Score** — Number and severity of blacklist flags across threat intelligence sources  
- **Geolocation Data** — Continent, country, city, ASN, ISP  
- **Anonymity Detection** — Tor usage, proxy/VPN indicators, hosting environment  
- **Reverse DNS** — Hostname associated with the IP (if available)  
- **Fraud Risk Score** — A unified score from 0–100 indicating IP risk level
