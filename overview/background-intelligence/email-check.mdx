Email Check verifies the authenticity of an email address and flags potential fraud
 signals tied to that email. It draws from domain reputation, 
 breach history, and public data. It's a fast, lightweight layer of
  identity validation with minimal friction.

***

#### Core Features

You receive a comprehensive profile for any email submitted, including:

- **Reputation Status** — High, Medium, or Low based on trust signals

- **Suspicion Flags** — Leakage, malice, breach exposure, spoofing risk

- **Domain Analysis** — Domain age, MX records, disposable or temporary email check

- **Public Profile Matches** — Aggregated social or profile presence tied to the email

- **Deliverability & Spam Signals** — Email validity indicators like SPF, DMARC, and accept-all config

This data helps you flag high-risk users early on in your verification workflow.

#### Use Cases

- **Fraud prevention**: Flag disposable, low-reputation, or breached accounts before account creation
