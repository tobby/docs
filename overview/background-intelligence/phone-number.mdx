Phone Number Check screens a user’s phone number to validate authenticity 
and uncover identity signals tied to that number. 

This check can serve as a lightweight KYC entry point or a fraud flag signal in standard onboarding flows.

#### Core Features

- **Phone Validation** — Confirms if the number is active, mobile or landline, and not disposable.

- **Carrier & Country Data** — See which network and country are associated with the number.

- **Social Account Matching** — Identify linked accounts (e.g. email, social profiles) tied to that phone.

- **Risk Score** — Flags high-risk numbers based on telco behavior and public data.

#### Use Cases

- **Risk Flagging**: Pre-screen phone numbers to detect high-risk users before approving risky accounts or actions.
