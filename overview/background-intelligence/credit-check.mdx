Credit Check enables businesses, especially those in financial services and lending, 
to assess the creditworthiness of individuals with speed and precision. 
The tool provides a centralized dashboard where credit assessments can be 
initiated, reviewed, and managed, alongside rich KYC data.

Credit checks can be performed by either entering the customer’s BVN or 
uploading their bank statements. This flexibility makes it easy to integrate
 into onboarding, risk assessment, or embedded finance flows.
