API logs provide a detailed and comprehensive history of every API call made within the application. This feature allows you to track, monitor, and analyze all API activity in one place.

You can view key details such as:


- The service that triggered the API call



- The mode (e.g., widget or API)



- The app that initiated the request



- 	The status code returned for each call
