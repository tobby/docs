### Create Application


To access any service on the platform, you’ll need to create an app. An app acts as your unique gateway to interact with the platform and is required to make API requests.

Once you initiate the app creation process, you can customize your app to reflect your brand. This includes:


- Naming your app to help identify it easily



- Uploading your logo for visual branding



- Setting a primary color that aligns with your brand’s identity

These customizations not only personalize your experience but also provide consistency for your users when interacting with your services through the platform.

The "name of app" is the only required field to differentiate the apps. You will need the logo and primary color if you would be using the [EasyOnboard](https://guides.dojah.io/user-manual/identity-verification/easyonboard) and features. This is better explained in their sections
