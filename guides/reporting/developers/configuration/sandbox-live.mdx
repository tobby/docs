description: "Access to two environments: Sandbox and Live. Users can easily build in the sandbox environment and move to live when you are production-ready. From the dashboard, users can seamlessly switch between"

The platform provides access to two distinct environments: **Sandbox and Live**.

- The Sandbox environment is a safe test space where users can experiment with Dojah’s services using test data. It allows you to simulate API calls, test workflows, and validate integrations without impacting real data or systems.
- The Live environment is the production-ready space where actual user data and real-time operations occur. Use this environment once your integration is ready to go live.

From the dashboard, users can seamlessly toggle between the Sandbox and Live environments to perform the following actions:

- Access and manage public and private API keys specific to each environment.
- Create apps in either environment to initiate requests and track performance.
