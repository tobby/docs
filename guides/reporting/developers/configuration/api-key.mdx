To integrate Dojah’s services outside of your application environment, you’ll need to use API keys. These keys serve as secure credentials that authorize your app to communicate with Dojah’s services.

You can easily access and copy your API keys from the Configuration page within your dashboard. However, to ensure security, you’ll be prompted to enter your account password before the keys are revealed. This security measure helps protect against unauthorized access.

If you suspect that your keys have been exposed or compromised, you can immediately regenerate new API keys from the same dashboard section. This ensures continued protection and secure communication between your app and the platform.
