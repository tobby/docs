This guide will walk you through the Credit Check dashboard, explaining how to perform a credit assessment, view the results, and analyze a customer's credit history. The Credit Check platform is used to check a customer's credit history to ascertain if they are eligible for certain services, primarily financial services.

You can initiate a new credit assessment directly from the main dashboard.

#### How it works

You start an assessment by clicking the "Perform Assessment" button. This opens a panel where you first select the app this check is for. Then, you choose one of two methods: either look up the customer directly using their BVN or generate a unique assessment link to send to the customer for them to complete.
