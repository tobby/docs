After an assessment is completed, the customer's details will appear in a list on the main Credit Check dashboard.

#### How it works

Once a check via BVN lookup or an assessment link is finished, a new entry is added to the main dashboard list. This list provides a high-level overview of all the checks you have performed. To see a detailed report, simply click on any entry in the list.


- The dashboard list displays the following details for each completed check:
	- Customer's Name

	- Phone Number

	- BVN

	- Status (e.g., Valid/Invalid)

	- Date/Time Created

- To open the detailed report for a specific customer, click on their entry in the list.
