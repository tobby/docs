Dojah’s AML Screening solution has evolved from simple watchlist checks to a complete AML case management system, designed to support your entire compliance workflow in one platform.

Our AML Screening system is a comprehensive compliance solution that enables businesses to detect and prevent financial crimes by screening individuals and entities against global watchlists, sanctions lists, and politically exposed person (PEP) databases. It provides an integrated workflow that supports everything from instant identity checks to deeper investigative processes, ensuring regulatory compliance and risk oversight at every stage of the customer lifecycle.
