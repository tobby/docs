### Enhanced Match Scoring Logic

The system will prioritize search results as follows:
- Sanctions over other AML types
- Exact name match over inexact name match
- Date of Birth (DOB) match over no DOB match
- Country match over no country match over country mismatch

### Sanctions
- 1.1 - Fuzzy match with country mismatch
- 1.2 - Fuzzy match
- 1.3 - Fuzzy match with country match
- 1.4 - Fuzzy match with YOB match
- 1.5 - Fuzzy match with YOB and country match
- 1.6 - Exact match with country mismatch
- 1.7 - Exact match
- 1.8 - Exact match with country match
- 1.9 - Exact match with YOB match
- 2.0 - Exact match with YOB and country match

### Warnings, PEPs, AMs
