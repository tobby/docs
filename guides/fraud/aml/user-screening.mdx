title: "User Screening"
description: "With User screening, businesses have the capability to conduct thorough Anti-Money Laundering (AML) lookups on individual users. This process involves comprehensive checks for any potential matches or correlations between the user's information and the AML watchlist or database."

User screening can be performed not only on an individual basis but also in batch, which means businesses have the ability to screen multiple users simultaneously. Instead of screening users one by one, batch screening allows businesses to process a larger volume of user data efficiently and effectively.

### HOW IT WORKS

-   Locate the AML screening tab on the side menu and click on it
    
-   Click on the dropdown and select User screening
    
-   Select app, enter first name, last name, middle name (optional), DOB (optional) & use the slider to select a match score of the person you want to screen
    
-   Click the lookup button to get result
    
-   A list of names will appear
    
-   Click on the name you are looking for to view results
    
-   Read through the result and also click on the relationships associated with the person to view their results.
