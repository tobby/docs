For Easy Detect to monitor transactions, you must send event data to your flow using its unique URLs. These are found in the flow's Settings tab.

#### How it works

Use the **Ingest URL** to send live transaction data for real-time analysis against your published rules. Use the **Backfill URL** to send historical data, which helps improve the accuracy of our machine learning models.


- **Realtime / Ingest URL**

	- This URL is used to send live events to your flow. Easy Detect will process these events in real-time against the rules you have set.

- **Enriching Your Flow with Historical Data (Backfill URL)**

	- This URL is used to send past transactional data to Easy Detect.

	- This historical data is used to enrich the system's understanding of normal account behavior, which is essential for our ML and AI analysis features.
