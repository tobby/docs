#### Managing Decisions

This section controls how the flow makes a final decision on an event after it has been evaluated by your rules.


- Use the slider to configure what status a given rule score represents. For example:

	- A score between 0 and 20 is Good.

	- A score between 21 and 70 is Pending (sent to Cases for review).

- Set the Retention Period, which is the historical period of data that should be analyzed for the transaction.

- Set the minimum and maximum number of transactions required to perform ML and behavioral analysis on an account.

- Once you are done, click Apply changes. You can also Reset the settings to their original state.
