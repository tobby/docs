Once a flow is created, you are taken to its main dashboard. This dashboard is the central hub for monitoring all activity within that specific flow and is organized into several tabs.

#### How it works

The Flow Dashboard gives you a complete picture of the activity passing through your rules. Use the tabs (Overview, Events, Cases, Accounts) to move between a high-level summary, detailed transaction lists, flagged cases needing review, and a directory of the accounts involved.

#### Overview Tab

- Provides a high-level summary and visualization of the events (transactions) that have been processed by the flow.

- **Events Tab**
	- Lists all individual events that have passed through the flow.

	- You can filter the view to see All Events or only Blocked Events.

	- Select any event to view more details, such as its risk score.

	- You can download a detailed event report in PDF format.

- **Cases Tab**

	- This tab displays events that the system has flagged as suspicious and are pending manual human review.

	- You can view details for each case and take action to either Block or Allow the event.

	- You can leave a note after a review is completed to provide context for your decision.

	- Filter between Pending Cases and Resolved Cases.
