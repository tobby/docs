From the main side navigation, you can access dashboards that consolidate information from all of your active flows in one place.

#### How it works

These global views allow you to manage high-priority items and see system-wide account activity without having to switch between individual flows.

- **Pending Cases**

	- This screen shows a list of all pending cases from every flow that is active and receiving events.

	- It allows you to quickly find and handle issues that require manual review, regardless of which flow they originated from.

- **Accounts**

	- This screen provides a comprehensive list of every account that has carried out an event across any of your flows.

	- You can select an account to view its detailed activity across the entire system.
