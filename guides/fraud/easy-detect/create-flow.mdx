A "Flow" is a dedicated workspace where you define a set of rules and configurations for a specific use case, like monitoring bank transfers or card payments. You can create a new flow from scratch or get a head start by using one of our pre-built templates.

#### How it works

You begin by either clicking the "Create a flow" button to build your own custom set of rules or by Browse the "Flow Templates" to use a vetted, pre-configured setup. Both methods allow you to quickly establish a monitoring environment tailored to your needs.

#### Creating a Flow from Scratch

- Navigate to the "Manage Flows" section, where you will see a list of your existing flows.

- Click the Create a flow button, located on the top-right corner of the screen.

- A pop-up window will appear, prompting you for the following details:
	- **Flow Name:** A unique name for your flow.

	- **Use Case:** Select a use case from the dropdown menu (e.g., Banking, Card).

	- **Description (Optional):** Add a brief description for your reference.

- You will see a list of available templates. Click the View this flow button on a template to see the rules it contains, including their risk levels and scores.
