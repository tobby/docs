Configuration allows businesses to tailor the look, behaviour, and experience of their verification flow by ensuring that onboarding is seamless, on-brand, and optimized for both internal teams and end users through the following actions:

- **Application configuration:** This is the first and essential step in flow creation. Linking a verification flow to an app enables businesses to properly call and track APIs for user verification. It also allows businesses to customize the appearance of the widget by adding their company logo and brand colours.


- **Country configuration:** It allows businesses to specify which countries are relevant for their user verification. Businesses are able to localize verifications for different user demographics.


- **Verification review:** It allows businesses to decide how verifications are reviewed. Manually or automatically.
	- **Manual review:** It allows the business’ designated reviewer to assess verification results via the dashboard to pass or fail verification.
	- **Automatic review:** It allows the system to automatically pass or fail verifications based on predefined verification logic and fraud rules.

- **Multiple device verification:** Allows users to continue their verification on other devices. For example, a user who starts their verification process on a laptop can continue it on their phone without restarting the verification process.


- **Notifications setup:** This setup ensures that the business’ team and their users stay informed throughout the verification process. Configuring notifications includes:
	- **Webhook Notifications:** Allows businesses to receive real-time verification updates. Ensuring backend or third-party systems are automatically notified as soon as a user’s verification status changes.
	- **Send Verification Status to Users:** Automatically notify users of their verification outcome via email
	- **Add Support Email:** Allows businesses to provide a support email within the widget interface so users can reach out for help if they get stuck or have questions during verification.
