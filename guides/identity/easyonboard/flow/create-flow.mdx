The verification flow enables businesses to create, customize, and manage identity verification processes tailored to their specific onboarding requirements.

#### How it Works

- Create a flow from scratch or choose from ready-made templates for faster setup.

- Name your flow by giving each flow a clear and unique title for easy tracking.

- Save your flow as a draft while building or updating it.

- Each saved flow automatically generates a unique flow link.

- Flows can be edited and reconfigured at any time to match changing onboarding needs.

- Clean up your workspace by deleting unused or outdated flow drafts.

- Once finalized, publish your flow to use as:
	- A shareable verification link

	- A direct integration through SDKs and APIs for seamless embedding into your web or mobile apps.
