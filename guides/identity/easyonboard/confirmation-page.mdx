The Confirmation Page allows businesses to customize how users conclude their verification journey, ensuring a smooth experience whether the verification is successful, failed, or pending review (verification awaiting confirmation).
Use default confirmation or add a redirect link that automatically sends users to a specified URL after their verification is completed.
