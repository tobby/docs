Fraud check enables businesses to detect and mitigate suspicious or fraudulent actions by setting rules and conditions that act as blockers during the onboarding and verification process.

Using fraud checks, businesses can automatically fail, pend for manual review, or fail users based on specific verification behaviours, data inconsistencies, and risk signals.

#### Businesses can detect fraud with the following rules:

1. **Detect with User Data:** It compares the user’s data (e.g., first name, last name, middle name, and date of birth) against official government records.
- If a mismatch occurs, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the verification.
	- Or pend the verification for manual review.

2. **Detect with Age Limit:** It verifies if the user's submitted date of birth matches government records.
- If discrepancies are found, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the verification for age-related compliance or eligibility violations.
	- Or pend the verification for manual review.

3. **Detect with Liveness:** It checks liveness verification for indicators of manipulation, like Brightness levels (to detect poor lighting or tampered images).
- If manipulation is detected, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the verification attempt.
	- Or pend for manual review.

4. **Detect Duplicate ID:** It checks if a user's email address, reference ID, or government-issued ID has previously been used in a verification attempt. It helps identify users who are trying to reuse credentials that have already been verified or passed through the onboarding process.
- If a duplicate is detected, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the new verification attempt.
	- Or pend for manual review.

5. **Detect with AML Screening:** It cross-checks user information against global AML watchlists and sanctions databases to identify individuals involved in financial crimes, money laundering, or terrorism financing.
- If a match is found, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the verification attempt.
	- Or pend for manual review for enhanced due diligence and further investigation.

6. **Detect with IP/Device Screening:** It checks IP addresses against known blacklists and suspicious geolocations.
- If suspicious activity is detected, businesses can:
	- Automatically fail the verification attempt.
	- Or pend for manual review.
