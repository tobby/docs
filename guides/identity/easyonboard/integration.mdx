The final step of configuring your verification flow is choosing how you want to deliver the experience to your users. The Integration options provide flexibility based on your product’s platform and user journey needs. Integration options include:

- **Web SDK Integration:**

	- Seamlessly embed the verification flow directly into your website or web application using our Web SDKs.

	- Customize the appearance and behavior to match your brand.

	- Offer users a smooth, uninterrupted experience without needing to leave your platform.

	- Ideal for businesses that want verification to feel like a natural part of their signup or onboarding flow.

- **Mobile SDK Integration:**

	- Extend the verification experience into your mobile applications (iOS and Android) with Mobile SDKs, by:

	- Ensuring a native mobile experience for users verifying through your app.

	- Leveraging device-specific features like camera access for ID and Liveness verification.

- **Flow Link Integration:**
Save flow to generate a unique, shareable link that directs users to a live verification flow.

	- No development effort needed to embed the flow.

	- Share the link via email, or SMS.
