Verification Pages allow businesses to build a structured, multi-step verification journey for their users. Each page represents a specific verification action (e.g., ID upload, selfie verification, etc.) that users must complete. Businesses can customize the combination order and requirements of these pages based on their onboarding needs and compliance requirements.
