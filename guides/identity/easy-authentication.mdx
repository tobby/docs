Easy Authentication is a streamlined authentication solution designed for businesses to re-authenticate users before critical activities, such as major transactions.

This feature simplifies the user experience by allowing fast re-verification instead of requiring full ID verification, which involves repetitive data entry. Easy Authentication leverages liveness verification to confirm that the returning user is genuine.

#### How it Works

- Easy Authentication verifies users by matching their live selfie image against a previously registered liveness image.
There are two ways to register a user for Easy Authentication:

  1. EasyOnboard: If the user has already completed a successful liveness verification during onboarding, you can use the associated Reference ID.

  2. EasyAuthentication: If no prior liveness exists, register the user directly via the EasyAuth widget for a quick, liveness-only capture.


- You can retrieve Reference IDs from the EasyOnboard Verifications Dashboard or the EasyAuthentication Customers Dashboard.

- Easy Authentication is triggered via the SDK, and results are sent to your configured webhook endpoint and displayed in the Authentication dashboard.
