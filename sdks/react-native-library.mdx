      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Run prebuild:

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

## Android Setup

### Requirements
* Minimum Android SDK version - 21
* Supported targetSdkVersion - 35

In your android root/build.gradle file set maven path:
```
...
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
Or Set maven path in your root/settings.gradle file:
```
...
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

### Permissions
For Android you don't need to declare permissions, its already included in the Package.

### iOS Setup

#### Requirements
* Minimum iOS version - 14

#### Add the following POD dependencies in your Podfile app under your App target

```
  pod 'Realm', '~> 10.52.2', :modular_headers => true
  pod 'DojahWidget', :git => 'https://github.com/dojah-inc/sdk-swift.git', :branch => 'pod-package'
```

example
```
target 'Example' do
  ...
  pod 'Realm', '~> 10.52.2', :modular_headers => true
  pod 'DojahWidget', :git => 'https://github.com/dojah-inc/sdk-swift.git', :branch => 'pod-package'
  ...
end
```
and run pod install in your iOS folder:
```sh
cd iOS
pod install
```


### Make some few changes in your AppDelegate.mm file

- Add the following imports:

```objective-c
#import <React/RCTBridge.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>
```

- Then replace application function in your AppDelegate with the following:

`REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE Your App Name,to the actual name of your App`

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  // Initialize the React Native bridge
  RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions];

  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge
                                                   moduleName:@"Your App Name"
                                            initialProperties:nil];

  UIViewController *rootViewController = [UIViewController new];
  rootViewController.view = rootView;

  // Wrap rootViewController in a UINavigationController
  UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:rootViewController];

  self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
  self.window.rootViewController = navigationController;
  [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];

  return YES;
}

```



### Permissions

For iOS, Add the following keys to your Info.plist file:

NSCameraUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called Privacy - Camera Usage Description in the visual editor.

NSMicrophoneUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the microphone, if you intend to record videos. This is called Privacy - Microphone Usage Description in the visual editor.

NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the location, if you intend to verify address/location. This is called Privacy - Location Usage Description in the visual editor.



### Usage

To start KYC, import Dojah in your React Native code, and launch Dojah Screen

```js
import {launchDojahKyc } from 'dojah-kyc-sdk-react_native';

launchDojahKyc(
  "{Required: Your_WidgetID}",
  "{Optional: Reference_ID}",
  "{Optional: Email_Address}"
)


//Example (If you're not passing Reference_ID and Email_Address values)

launchDojahKyc("1234678901234", "DJ-123456", "abc@gmail.com")


//Example (If you're not passing Reference_ID and Email_Address values)

launchDojahKyc("1234678901234", null, null)



```

### SDK Parameters
- `WidgetID` - a `REQUIRED` parameter. You get this ID when you sign up on the Dojah platform, follow the next step to generate your WidgetId.
- `Reference ID` - an `OPTIONAL` parameter that allows you to initialize the SDK for an ongoing verification.
- `Email Address` - an `OPTIONAL` parameter that allows you to initialize the SDK for an ongoing verification.

### How to Get a Widget ID
To use the SDK, you need a WidgetID, which is a required parameter for initializing the SDK. You can obtain this by creating a flow on the Dojah platform. Follow these steps to configure and get your Widget ID:

```txt
1. Log in to your Dojah Dashboard: If you don’t have an account, sign up on the Dojah platform.

2. Navigate to the EasyOnboard Feature: Once logged in, find the EasyOnboard section on your dashboard.

3. Create a Flow:

    - Click on the 'Create a Flow' button.
    - Name Your Flow: Choose a meaningful name for your flow, which will help you identify it later.

4. Add an Application:

    - Either create a new application or add an existing one.
    - Customise your widget with your brand logo and color by selecting an application.

5. Configure the Flow:

    - Select a Country: Choose the country or countries relevant to your verification process.
    - Select a Preview Process: Decide between automatic or manual verification.
    - Notification Type: Choose how you’d like to receive notifications for updates (email, SMS, etc.).
    - Add Verification Pages: Customize the verification steps in your flow (e.g., ID verification, address verification, etc.).

6. Publish Your Widget: After configuring your flow, publish the widget. Once published, your flow is live.

7. Copy Your Widget ID: After publishing, the platform will generate a Widget ID. Copy this Widget ID as you will need it to initialize the SDK as stated above.
